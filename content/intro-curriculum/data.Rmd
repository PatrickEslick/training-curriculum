This data was pulled from NWIS and manipulated to create datasets that highlight some of the troublesome characteristics of working with data in R (such as empty or missing values). As such, these datasets do not accurately represent what is stored in NWIS. Take a look at the [script used to create these data files](../data/create_df.R) to see exactly how the NWIS data was changed.
