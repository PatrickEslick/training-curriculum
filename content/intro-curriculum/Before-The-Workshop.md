Prior to the start of the workshop everyone will need to have had the software installed and tested. Please follow [these instructions](/installr) for installing R and RStudio. If you do not have install access to your computer (often called "PR access"), you will need to contact your IT representative to have them install it, and can direct them to the [install page](/installr).
