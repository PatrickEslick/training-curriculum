## Minimum Package Requirements

There are many excellent resources on how to create an R package. The official documentation is [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html). This is the official guide, and R-package developers should absolutely refer back to this page for reference. A common companion to that is Hadley's [Writing R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). It is a very complete guide to the mechanics of R-packages. This section provides the briefest of introductions, but enough to get you started. 

## Package Skeleton

Let's build a bare-bones package from scratch, defining each section as we go. We are using RStudio as our working environment, so let's first create a new Project called "demoPackage". Note we could do all of this by hand as well.

**Step 1:** Open New Project:

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/newProject.png" alt="New Project", title="New Project">


**Step 2:** Choose New Package option:

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/newPackage.png" alt="New Package", title="New Package">

**Step 3:** Name your package:

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/newPackageII.png" alt="Name Package", title="Name Package">


**Step 4:** Discover your package!

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/packageSkeleton.png" alt="Minimum Package Requirements", title="Minimum Package Requirements">


## Minimum Required Content

There are just a few files and folders created in the above process. These are the absolute minimum required to build a package. As this workshop goes on, we will introduce more options for directories and files. 

### R folder

Any R code that will be executed goes in the "R" folder. You can save one or many files (with a .R extension) that will run when the package is loaded. By using RStudio's package wizard, they created a file "hello.R", which created a "Hello World" function.

### man folder

The "man" folder contains the files used to create each function's "help" file (the documentation). We will discuss the requirements at length in the [Documentation](/r-package-dev/doc) section. Assuming you use the `roxygen2` package, you will not need to create these files by hand, they will be generated by information in the R folder. 

### DESCRIPTION file

The [DESCRIPTION](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file) file contains basic information on the package. Do not leave the fields with their defaults. See also [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html) for more information.

One thing to remember...we will be using `roxygen2` for most of our documentation work. `roxgyen2` will **not** update the DESCRIPTION file. If you add a new package dependency....you **must** manually add that to this file, either in the "Depends", "Imports", or "Suggests" field. More [below](#Depends)

### NAMESPACE file

The [NAMESPACE](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Package-namespaces) file shows what functions and methods are exported and imported. Assuming we use the `roxygen2` package, this file should not need to be changed by hand. However, it is a very important file for R packages. It is also a somewhat difficult subject to explain in a simple way. See [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html) for a detailed discussion.


## Build, Check, Share

RStudio created a package skeleton. Let's build the package to see if it builds correctly. Then, we can check it, to see if it passes all of the R-package requirements.

**Step 1:** Build:

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/Build.png" alt="Build Package", title="Build Package">

Our `demoPackage` built! This screenshot used RStudio's "Build" tab. There are other ways to build a package, but during this workshop, we will focus on the tools embedded in RStudio. 

**Step 2:** Check:

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/Check.png" alt="Check Package", title="Check Package">

The initial "Check" shows 0 errors (great!), 1 warning (need to fix!), and 0 notes (great!). The warning's message is pretty informative (`Non-standard license specification What license is it under`). So, we need to update our DESCRIPTION file with the license information. See [below](#License) for more discussion on licenses.

**Step 3:** Share:

Let's say you've fixed all the errors, warnings, and notes on your package, and now you'd like to share it with a few people. You can build the package "source" file. Here is how you build the source:

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/Build_Source.png" alt="Create Source", title="Create Source">

The output in the "Build" tab window is:
```
==> devtools::build()

"C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-34~1.0PA/bin/x64/R" --no-site-file --no-environ --no-save  \
  --no-restore --quiet CMD build "D:\LADData\RCode\demoPackage"  \
  --no-resave-data --no-manual 

* checking for file 'D:\LADData\RCode\demoPackage/DESCRIPTION' ... OK
* preparing 'demoPackage':
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files
* checking for empty or unneeded directories
* building 'demoPackage_0.1.0.tar.gz'

[1] "D:/LADData/RCode/demoPackage_0.1.0.tar.gz"
```

So, now I can take my file "demoPackage_0.1.0.tar.gz" and share it. Maybe to start, I want to just email it to a co-worker, and have them install it. If you can send them that file, and they put it in their working directory, they can install like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("demoPackage_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

```

If you are a Windows developer sending to a Windows developer, or Mac sending to Mac, you could choose the "Build Binary Package" option. To avoid confusion, assuming you have a package that doesn't rely on compiled code, choosing "source" makes it easier to handle cross-operating-system collaborations.

Then to run the package:

```
library(demoPackage)
hello()
[1] "Hello, world!"
```

We will discuss other methods to share your package, including [Github](https://github.com), [GRAN](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/gran.html), and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## More Sub-Directories

Aside from the "R" and "man" folders, there are others that can be included in a package. Here is a brief introduction to those folders. Some will be discussed further in this course. Others can be explored further from online references. 

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Folder <- c("R", "data", "demo", "exec", "inst", "man", "po", "src", "tests", "tools", "vignettes")

Description <- c("Collection of R code",
                "Example data sets saved in R binary format",
                "R scripts to show example workflows. These are losing favor over vignettes",
                "Executable scripts",
                "Installed files, basically, any file that you want to include in it's original format can be stored here",
                "Documentation/help files",
                "Translations for R- and C-level error and warning messages",
                "Compiled Code such as C, C++, or Fortran",
                "testthat code testing files",
                "Auxiliary files needed during configuration",
                "Files to create the detailed vignette files/user guides"
                
  
)

library(htmlTable)
htmlTable(data.frame(Folder, Description), 
          caption="Table 1. Possible Folders in an R-Package",
          rnames=FALSE, align=c("l","l"), col.rgroup = c("none", "#F7F7F7"), 
          css.cell="padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 0.5em;")
```


## More Files

Aside from the "DESCRIPTION" and "NAMESPACE" files, there are others that can be included in a package. Here is a brief introduction to those files Some will be discussed further in this course. Others can be explored further from online references. This list is not exhaustive. There are many other files that can be seen on R-Package github repositories. Some that we may explore in this workshop for example, ".travis.yml", "appveyor.yml", "codecov.yml" are used to configure continuous integration services.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Files <- c("DESCRIPTION", "NAMESPACE", "NEWS", "README", "CITATION", "LICENSE","CONTRIBUTING",".Rbuildignore")

Description <- c("Basic information on the package",
                 "Exported and imported functions and methods",
                 "Information on package changes/updates",
                 "Useful information to package users, but ignored by R",
                 "Official information on how to cite the package",
                 "Specific information on licencing",
                 "Information on how to contribute to the package",
                 "List of files to ignore when doing the package build")

library(htmlTable)
htmlTable(data.frame(Files, Description), 
          caption="Table 2. Possible Files in an R-Package",
          rnames=FALSE, align=c("l","l"), col.rgroup = c("none", "#F7F7F7"), 
          css.cell="padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 0.5em;")
```




## Data

There are several ways to add data to your package. See [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html#data) for more information. We will describe 3 methods here:

### inst/extdata subdirectory

You can put data in a folder in the "inst/extdata" folder. This data will be available to the user in it's original format. For example, in the `dataRetrieval` package, we include example data that shows various data formats. This data can be accessed as follows:

```{r}
library(dataRetrieval)

path_to_data <- system.file("extdata", "RDB1Example.txt", package = "dataRetrieval")

path_to_data

```

This data is not automatically exported in the package. For `dataRetrieval`, we could open the data file by using `dataRetrieval` parsing functions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rdb_data <- importRDB1(path_to_data)

```

### data subdirectory

If the raw file format is not important, data sets can be included in the "data" subdirectory. This data needs to be saved as either ".RData" or ".rda" (both R binary extensions). The [`EGRET`](https://github.com/USGS-R/EGRET) package offers some example data sets in the "data" folder: `Choptank_eList` and `Arkansas_eList`. The data still needs to be exported (this will be discussed later). See [here](https://github.com/USGS-R/EGRET/blob/master/R/EGRET.R) for the `EGRET` example.

If you have `LazyData: true` in the DESCRIPTION file, the data can be accessed easily:

```{r }
library(EGRET)
names(Choptank_eList)
```

A minor detail...this data will not appear in your Environment until you specifically load it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Choptank_eList <- Choptank_eList
```

<img class="sideBySide" src="../static/img/EGRET_data.png" alt="EGRET data", title="EGRET data">

### sysdata.rda

If data is to be used within the R code (for example, a look-up table), it can go in a R binary file called "sysdata.rda" that is placed within the "R" subdirectory. By default, this data is available for functions within your package, but not exposed. 

To expose the sysdata, see the example in [`dataRetrieval`](https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval/blob/master/R/tabbedDataRetrievals.R). The important lines in the `roxygen2` code (much more to be discussed on that in the [Documentation Lesson](/r-package-dev/doc)):

```
#' @docType data
#' @export stateCd
NULL
```

This adds the line `export(stateCd)` to the NAMESPACE file.

<a name="Depends"></a>

## Depending on other packges

There are many good reasons for your package to use functions from other packages. These are called dependencies. 

Use care, however, to decide if the package is stable and actively maintained. If you depend on packages that change their behavior or results, **your** package will also start to change it's behavior. 

When you do require a package, it's best to only import the specific functions that you need. So, rather than depending on the entire `dataRetrieval` package, only depend on the functions within `dataRetrieval` that you need. Let's create a throwaway function in our `demoPackage` that gets daily discharge values from a site, and then uses `dplyr` to calculate daily summaries. 

Here's the function if we were to write it as a script:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dataRetrieval)
library(dplyr)

summary_dv <- function(site){
  dv_data <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers=site, 
                        parameterCd = "00060", startDate = "", endDate = "")

  dv_summ <- renameNWISColumns(dv_data)
  dv_summ <- mutate(dv_summ, doy = as.numeric(strftime(Date, format = "%j")))
  dv_summ <- group_by(dv_summ, doy)
  dv_summ <- summarise(dv_summ,
                       max = max(Flow, na.rm = TRUE),
                       min = min(Flow, na.rm = TRUE))
  return(dv_summ)

}

summary_dv("08279500")

```

To get that into our `demoPackage`, first we need to add `dataRetrieval` and `dplyr` to the "Imports" section. It is best-practice to add them to "Imports" rather than "Depends" because the packages will only be imported when needed, rather than fully loaded. So, first, let's update the DESCRIPTION file to this:

```
Package: demoPackage
Type: Package
Title: Throwaway demo package
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Laura", "DeCicco", role = c("aut","cre"),
    email = "ldecicco@usgs.gov"))
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
License: CC0
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports: 
  dataRetrieval,
  dplyr

```

Now, we need to add some `roxygen2` info to the function (this will be described in detail in the [Documentation](/r-package-dev/doc) section). So, save this to a file in the "R" folder in the `demoPackage` project:


```
#' summary_dv
#'
#' Get max and min of discharge for day of the year.
#'
#' @export
#' @param site character USGS site ID
#' @importFrom dataRetrieval readNWISdv
#' @importFrom dataRetrieval renameNWISColumns
#' @importFrom dplyr mutate
#' @importFrom dplyr group_by
#' @importFrom dplyr summarise
#' @examples
#' site <- "08279500"
#' sum_dv <- summary_dv(site)
summary_dv <- function(site){
  Date <- doy <- Flow <- ".dplyr.var"

  dv_data <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers=site,
                        parameterCd = "00060", startDate = "", endDate = "")

  dv_summ <- renameNWISColumns(dv_data)
  dv_summ <- mutate(dv_summ, doy = as.numeric(strftime(Date, format = "%j")))
  dv_summ <- group_by(dv_summ, doy)
  dv_summ <- summarise(dv_summ,
                       max = max(Flow, na.rm = TRUE),
                       min = min(Flow, na.rm = TRUE))
  return(dv_summ)

}
```

Your first question might be, what is this line?
```{r}
Date <- doy <- Flow <- ".dplyr.var"
```

`dplyr` uses "Non-Standard Evaluation" (NSE) so that we can refer to columns in a data frame without surrounding them in quotes. On the package Check though, these NSE names get flagged with notes. Creating these "dummy" variables eliminates the Note. See more [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/nse.html) for details. There are also ways within the `dplyr` package to perform Standard Evaluations. 

I also deleted the `hello` function, and it's corresponding .Rd file in the "man" folder. We could keep it...but now that we're depending on `roxygen2` to create the documentation, we'd need to add the mandatory header information to that function. Since this is just a throw-away package, I just deleted it. Also, to get `roxygen2` to build the NAMESPACE file, I had to delete the originally created file. This is a precautionary measure from `roxygen2` to not overwrite anything that doesn't have a header "# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand".

When we build the package, if we have `roxygen2` working properly, our NAMESPACE file should now look like this:

```
# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand

export(summary_dv)
importFrom(dataRetrieval,readNWISdv)
importFrom(dataRetrieval,renameNWISColumns)
importFrom(dplyr,group_by)
importFrom(dplyr,mutate)
importFrom(dplyr,summarise)
```

Run the Check to make sure there are still no error or warnings. 

We can load the updates to the package, and see our in-development help files:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(demoPackage)
?summary_dv

#Try out the example:
site <- "08279500"
sum_dv <- summary_dv(site)

```

Finally, be aware there is a 3rd level of package dependency. We could add packages to the "Suggests" field in the DESCRIPTION file. These are packages that might be used in the vignette or help files, or packages such as `knitr` or `testthat` that are not directly used within the package itself, but needed to build.

<a name="License"></a>

## License and Disclaimers

It is important to understand the policies of distributing code as a federal US employee. Please check for updates to any policy before releasing software. We do not guarantee that the following information will always be up-to-date and correct. See [USGS-manual](https://www2.usgs.gov/laws/info_policies.html), [DOI](https://www.doi.gov/disclaimer), and [software release](https://www2.usgs.gov/usgs-manual/im/IM-OSQI-2016-01.html) for the most official guidance on licenses and disclaimers. 

Technically, US federal employees should not have a license associated with their code (completely open, unrestricted code). R requires a license, and we have been told then that it's OK to use the [CC0](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0) license:

<img class="autoImg" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png" alt="CC0", title="CC0", height="31" width="88">

USGS employees should also be adding a Disclaimer to their README:

```
Disclaimer: This software is in the public domain because it contains materials that originally came from the U.S. Geological Survey, an agency of the United States Department of Interior. For more information, see the official USGS copyright policy

Although this software program has been used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), no warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government as to the accuracy and functioning of the program and related program material nor shall the fact of distribution constitute any such warranty, and no responsibility is assumed by the USGS in connection therewith.

This software is provided "AS IS."
```

We also require a message on packages that have not been officially released. Adding this to any file in the R folder will cause a message to be displayed when a user opens the library:

```
.onAttach <- function(libname, pkgname) {
  packageStartupMessage("Although this software program has been used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), no warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government as to the accuracy and functioning of the program and related program material nor shall the fact of distribution constitute any such warranty, and no responsibility is assumed by the USGS in connection therewith.")
}

```

If this was added to our `demoPackage`, we would see this on load:

```
library(demoPackage)
Although this software program has been used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), no warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government as to the accuracy and functioning of the program and related program material nor shall the fact of distribution constitute any such warranty, and no responsibility is assumed by the USGS in connection therewith.

```
