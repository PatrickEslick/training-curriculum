There are a number of advanced R developers across the USGS who write scripts to perform important analyses. They often want to share the workflows and steps associated with the analysis, but passing around scripts that require users to change hard-coded inputs can be cumbersome and inefficient. This course gives advanced R programmers the skills they need to turn their scripted workflows into an R package. R packages allow code to be bundled into functions and easily downloaded and installed by users. Packages contain documentation and help files that should minimize questions asked of package authors.

## Course objectives

1. Improve R programming skills.
2. Create a manageable, testable, and version-controlled codebase for your analysis.
3. Easily and openly share your workflows and methods with others as R packages.

## Software setup

Software installation:

- [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) (latest version)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/) (>1.0)
- [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (compatible with your version of R)
- R packages: devtools, roxygen2, testthat, knitr

## Suggested prerequisite knowledge

This course discusses advanced topics in programming. Transitioning from a scripting mentality to package development can be challenging; we recommend you have advanced knowledge of R programming to use this curriculum. Please refer to the list below to see if you qualify. In addition, putting time and effort into package development is more useful if you have an existing script that could be useful to yourself and others if it were turned into a package.

I am comfortable ...

- loading files into data.frames.
- differentiating data structures and data types.
- indexing vectors, data.frames, or lists.
- creating scatter, line, or boxplots and saving the output as a PNG/JPG.
- writing for loops.
- using logical statements (>, >=, ==).
- writing conditional statements (if, if-else).
- installing, loading, and using additional packages.
- troubleshooting/decrypting error messages.
- writing and using my own functions.

## Course overview

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
getWeight <- function(rmdPath){
  rmdLines <- readLines(rmdPath)
  weight_i <- grep("weight:", rmdLines)
  weight_format <- gsub('weight: ', '', rmdLines[weight_i])
  weight_final <- as.numeric(weight_format)
  return(weight_final)
}

getTitle <- function(rmdPath){
  rmdLines <- readLines(rmdPath)
  title_i <- grep("title:", rmdLines)[1]
  title_format <- gsub('title: ', '', rmdLines[title_i])
  title_final <- gsub('\"', '', title_format)
  return(title_final)
}

getObjectives <- function(rmdPath){
  rmdLines <- readLines(rmdPath)
  start_i <- grep("## Lesson Objectives", rmdLines)
  all_sections <- grep("##", rmdLines)
  end_i <- all_sections[which(all_sections == start_i) + 1]
  all_lines <- rmdLines[start_i:end_i]
  all_rmsections <- all_lines[!grepl("##", all_lines)]
  all_rmblanks <- all_rmsections[-which(nchar(all_rmsections) == 0)]
  all_final <- paste(all_rmblanks, collapse = "<br/>")
  return(all_final)
}

fnames <- list.files(pattern = ".Rmd")
fnames <- fnames[-grep("Getting_Started", fnames)]
weights <- unlist(lapply(fnames, getWeight))
Module <- unlist(lapply(fnames, getTitle))[order(weights)]
Objectives <- unlist(lapply(fnames, getObjectives))[order(weights)]

htmlTable(data.frame(Module, Objectives), 
            caption=paste0("Table 1. Summary of available modules."),
            rnames=FALSE, align=c("l","l"), col.rgroup = c("none", "#F7F7F7"), 
            css.cell="padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 0.5em;")
