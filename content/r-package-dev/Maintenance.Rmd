Package maintenance is the process of continuing to keep your package operating effectively over time, including keeping up with changes to R itself and the underlying packages that your package depends on. Additionally package maintainence often involves addressing minor bugs and optionally includes adding new features. 

## Lesson Objectives

Defining these and fleshing them are all WIP:
1. Define various levels of maintenance and user groups 
2. Discuss strategies for short- and long-term package maintenance.
3. Communicating your level of support

## Introduction to package maintenance concepts

So, what are you really on the hook for when creating a package? It depends on what your package was intended for, how complex it is, how robust well designed it is for imand what the expectations are from the users you are supporting. Your level of effort  user group, expected level of support, and complexity

### User groups

* Individual (you are building this package for yourself, and future you)
* Core group of knowledgeable users (a package created to capture common or shared processes within a group)
* Mix of known users with various levels of skill (similar to above, but with users that may not understand R basics)
* Unknown users with wide skill distribution (the typical case of CRAN)

### Level of support

Defining the level of support you offer users can help you priorotize maintenance efforts and keep ...

* no expectations of support
* Fixes/changes only applied when in development mode
* Changes agreed upon by committee (thus delayed?)

A note on support: Deferentiate between general R support and package support...

## Setting expectations for package maintenance

### Sunset dates and other disclaimers
e.g., .onLoad()

### Communicating through the package version

### Deprecation of functions or features

### Failing fast for unimplemented features
e.g., point to github issues

### Define *how* to engage with package developers
e.g., github, email, other


## Maintaining your R package

### Planning and priorotizing maintenance and improvements

Common pitfalls:
* "This will be a fun feature to implement" wins over "Users need this"
* death by a thousand commits


### Diversifying package support
add/recruit other maintainers
rely on support forums or other engagement to help answer user questions

Common pitfalls:
* I can solve it quick

### The many benefits to simpler code
better for you, better for other (potential contributors)
This includes how you write, and what other packages you rely on

Common pitfalls:
* clever vs clean
* Premature optimization

### Understanding the dependency tree

Common pitfalls:
* backwards compatibility
* Implicitly relying on key features of an dependency update

### Getting out ahead of incoming problems

Avoding the inconvienent scramble

### Creating a maintenance rhythmn 

### How to gracefully throw in the towell

### Stepping up effort and expectations
