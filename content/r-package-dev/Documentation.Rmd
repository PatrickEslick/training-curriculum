The quality of documentation for an R package can determine success or failure. Less documentation generally results in higher burdens, so it's best add extensive documentation as early as possible. Consider different audiences when writing pacakge documentation: the users, current or future developers, and future you. The better documented your package, the less like you are to be burdened by answering user questions, helping onboard future developers, and spending time remembering details about the code.

## Lesson Objectives

1. Distinguish the types of documentation for R packages.
2. Develop documentation for individual functions.
3. Create a vignette to highlight the top-level package uses.
4. Edit and update README files.

## Components of package documentation

Here are the components of package documentation. 

- **Function help files:** Help files are the files that document functions at an individual level and are created using Roxygen syntax (we will use the [`roxygen2` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html)). Roxygen allows your code and documentation to be colocated, which makes remembering to update documentation with code changes much easier.

- **Vignettes:** HTML or PDF files that illustrate potential workflows or topics within the package. They generally are high-level, illustrating how to apply the package functions to complete an analysis.

- **README:** This is a single file that includes directions for how to quickly get setup and started. It might include a simple workflow or call out specific functions that people might find interesting. It is essentially your chance to advertise why people should use your package. 

## Help files

Help files are accessed when users run `?functionName`, e.g. `?mean` brings you to the help file for the function `mean`. Help files describe a function, provide the arguments and argument definitions, show default arguments when applicable, describe what the function returns to the user, points to additional resources or related functions, provides reproducible examples, and documents statistical methods and references. We create these helpfiles using Roxygen syntax, where documentation lives with the code it corresponds to. Roxygen comments are added to the same file the function is declared. When the package source files are "roxygenized", the roxygen-formatted comments are converted into `.Rd` files and added to the folder `man`. Although, the `.Rd` files look complex, R converts them to human readable formats to show when the `?` or `help` functions are used.

Roxygen style documentation requires the R package `roxygen2`. This package needs to be installed in order to generate the `.Rd` files, but does not need to be listed as a dependency in the `DESCRIPTION` file. **RoxygenNote: 6.0.1 ?!?! in dataRetrieval**

Roxygen comments always begin with an apostrophe after the regular R comment symbol. They are followed by an `@` and then the tag specifying what section of the help file is being described. Then, details about that section are added. The roxygen comments go directly above the function you are documenting. 

If you have the following function,

```{r eval=FALSE}
is.valid.pH <- function(pH){
    pH >= 0 & pH <= 14
}
```

the roxygen comments would be added directly above it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' Location of Roxygen comments
#' 
is.valid.pH <- function(pH){
    pH >= 0 & pH <= 14
}
```

The main elements to include in the roxygen comments are the title, description, arguments, returned values, and examples. See [the RStudio devtools Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) for a more complete list of roxygen comment and formatting elements. Note that the "Usage" field in the help file is automatically added based on your function signature.

To add the title and description, use `@title` and `@description`. Note: you can just hit enter at the end of a Roxygen line and it will automatically add `#'` at the start of the next line. Just use backspace to delete if you don't want the Roxygen syntax.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' @title Determine if a pH value is valid.
#' @description Test to see if the pH value is greater than or equal 
#' to zero and less than or equal to fourteen.
#'
is.valid.pH <- function(pH){
    pH >= 0 & pH <= 14
}
```

The title, description, and details fields do not require the roxygen `@` tags as long as they are specified in order (title, then description, then details). All other elements require the appropriate roxygen tag.

To add arguments, use the tag `@param` followed by the argument name, and then the argument description. Building on our documentation example, 

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' @title Determine if a pH value is valid.
#' @description Test to see if the pH value is greater than or equal 
#' to zero and less than or equal to fourteen.
#' @param pH a numeric vector indicating the pH. Characters will return `FALSE`.
#'
is.valid.pH <- function(pH){
    pH >= 0 & pH <= 14
}
```

This function only has one argument, but if there were more they would be added starting on the next line using the same syntax. In the argument descriptions, it is best to say what class and lengths are expected, consider the following: 

- What data structure is expected? Data frame, vector, list, length 1 vector?
- What class is required? Numeric, logical, character?

This is your opportunity to tell the user exactly what they need to know in order to effectively use your function. You can also use [markdown formatting](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/) to make words bold, italic, code (as shown in this example), or links to web or other help pages. You can also reference the [RStudio devtools Cheatsheet for examples](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf).

Next, you should describe the output of this function using the tag `@return`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' @title Determine if a pH value is valid.
#' @description Test to see if the pH value is greater than or equal 
#' to zero and less than or equal to fourteen.
#' @param pH a numeric vector indicating the pH. Characters will return \code{FALSE}.
#' @return a vector of logicals indicating whether the pH value was between 0 and 14
#'
is.valid.pH <- function(pH){
    pH >= 0 & pH <= 14
}
```

Similar to the argument descriptions, your description of what the function returns should include data structure and class information.

The final function documentation element we are going to discuss is the example section. Examples are arguably the most important piece to include in your function documentation. Users should be able to copy and paste your examples, get an idea of what the function does, and then ammend them for their own purposes. You can add examples of a function by using the roxygen tag `@examples` followed by R code. The code should still follow the roxygen comment symbol `#'`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' @title Determine if a pH value is valid.
#' @description Test to see if the pH value is greater than or equal 
#' to zero and less than or equal to fourteen.
#' @param pH a numeric vector indicating the pH. Characters will return \code{FALSE}.
#' @return a vector of logicals indicating whether the pH value was between 0 and 14
#' @examples
#' is.valid.pH(5)
#' is.valid.pH(-5)
#' is.valid.pH(1:15)
#' is.valid.pH("4")
#'  
#' set.seed(5)
#' pH_vals <- runif(5, -3, 20)
#' is.valid.pH(pH_vals)
#'
is.valid.pH <- function(pH){
    pH >= 0 & pH <= 14
}
```

Sometimes people use `\dontrun{}` to show examples of code that will cause in error. To use this, add your example code that will cause an error inside of the `{ }`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' @title Determine if a pH value is valid.
#' @description Test to see if the pH value is greater than or equal 
#' to zero and less than or equal to fourteen.
#' @param pH a numeric vector indicating the pH
#' @return a vector of logicals indicating whether the pH value was between 0 and 14
#' @examples
#' is.valid.pH(5)
#' is.valid.pH(-5)
#' is.valid.pH(1:15)
#' 
#' set.seed(5)
#' pH_vals <- runif(5, -3, 20)
#' is.valid.pH(pH_vals)
#' 
#' \dontrun{
#' is.valid.pH()
#' }
#'
is.valid.pH <- function(pH){
    pH >= 0 & pH <= 14
}
```

Now that your roxygen comments have been added, you need to build the resulting `.Rd` files. Setup your *Build Tools* to automatically convert roxygen to `.Rd` each time you build and reload the package. Go to the *Build Tab*, click *More*, then *Configure Build Tools*, and then click the checkmark next to *Generate documentation with Roxygen*. Next to *Generate documentation with Roxygen*, click *Configure* and make sure that everything is checked. 

Once you build your `.Rd` files, you will see them appear in the `man` folder. Each function will have its own `.Rd`. You should now be able to use `?functionName` and see your help file. For the example we have been following, we should be able to see our help file by executing `?is.valid.pH`.

## Vignettes

Vignettes are PDF or HTML files made available to your users when they execute `help` and specify a package name, e.g. `help(package="dataRetrieval")`. Vignettes are typically used to explain information about the package that does not fit into the individual function documentation, such as common usages and workflows, or background information. It's a good rule of thumb to include at least one vignette to illustrate a typical workflow that someone might expect to use with your package.

Vignettes are created using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files and the `rmarkdown` package. This course will not teach how to use R Markdown, so please refer to the following links for reference:

- [R Markdown quick tour](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html)
- [R Markdown overview](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
- [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
- [R Markdown examples](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)

Most vignettes you will see now are HTML not PDF files because it can be difficult to knit to PDF. We will only show how to create HTML vignettes here. To start, create a top-level directory called `vignettes` in your package. Using the `devtools` function `use_vignettes`, you can set up the vignette template. Try it by executing `devtools::use_vignettes("my-vignette")`. You should now see an `.Rmd` (R Markdown) file in your new `vignettes` folder with the name "my-vignette". When you open the file, you will see that the header includes the following:

```
title: "Vignette Title"
author: "Vignette Author"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
```

Including `Sys.Date()` in the date field is optional but highly recommended because anytime you update the vignette, it will automatically update. The default vignette also includes a lot of information about vignettes, so don't forget to delete this to make room for your content.

In the body of the R Markdown document, add a code chunk that loads the `rmarkdown` package (`library(rmarkdown)`). Populate the rest of the document as you would any other R Markdown file. Remember, if you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, visit the list of references from above. Here's a quick example of what the .Rmd would look like:

```
---
title: "Basic workflow of `myAwesomePackage`"
author: "Vignette Author"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---

# `myAwesomePackage`

This package is really great. It does a bunch of cool stuff. This vignette walks you through the most basic implementation.

## Getting data

etc ...

```

Save your new R Markdown file. The next time you build your package, your vignette should now be available!

## READMEs

The README file is a top-level markdown file that usually contains information about how to install the package, how to get started on some basic functions, where to go for reporting bugs or feature requests, and a disclaimer or copyright information about the open source software. All USGS packages have the Disclaimer field in the README that points to [the official USGS copyright policy](https://www2.usgs.gov/visual-id/credit_usgs.html#copyright/). Note that README files are shown on the home page of a GitHub repository, and is a good way to summarize why people should use your package. 

![](../static/img/README_on_github.png)

The previous section discussed how to format R Markdown (`.Rmd` ) files and knit them to Markdown files (`.md`). README files are created in a similar way, you just need to include the following as your R Markdown header:

```
title: "README"
author: "R"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown_github
```

Here is an example `README.Rmd`:

```
---
title: "README"
author: "R"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown_github
---

#`myAwesomePackage`

A package with really awesome functions that are used to help creating amazingly reproducible workflows.

##Installation

To install the myAwesomePackage package, you must be using R 3.0 or greater and run the following command: `install.packages("myAwesomePackage")`.
  
##Reporting bugs

Please consider reporting bugs and asking questions on the Issues page.
