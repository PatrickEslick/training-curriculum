Although ScienceBase is a great platform for uploading and storing your data, you can also use it to find other available data. You can do that manually by searching using the ScienceBase web interface or through `sbtools` functions.

## Discovering data via web interface

The most familiar way to search for data would be to use the ScienceBase search capabilities available online. You can search for any publically available data in the [ScienceBase catalog](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/). Search by category (map, data, project, publication, etc), topic-based tags, or location; or search by your own key words.

Learn more about the [catalog search features](www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/explore-sciencebase#2. Search ScienceBase) and explore the [advanced searching capabilities](www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/sciencebase-advanced-search) on the ScienceBase help pages.

## Discovering data via sbtools

The ScienceBase search tools can be very powerful, but lack the ability to easily recreate the search. If you want to incorporate dataset queries into a reproducible workflow, you can script them using the `sbtools` query functions. The terminology differs from the web interface slightly. There are three functions available to query the catalog:

1. `query_sb_text` (matches title or description)
2. `query_sb_doi` (use a DOI identifier)
3. `query_sb_spatial` (data within or at a specific location)


## Best of both methods
