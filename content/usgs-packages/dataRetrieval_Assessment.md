Before continuing with this lesson, you should make sure that the `dataRetrieval` package is installed and loaded. If you haven't recently updated, you could reinstall the package by running `install.packages('dataRetrieval')` or go to the "Update" button in the "Packages" tab in RStudio.

``` r
# load the dataRetrieval package
library(dataRetrieval)
```
