Before continuing with this lesson, you should make sure that the `sbtools` package is installed and loaded. If you haven't recently updated, you could reinstall the package by running `install.packages('sbtools')` or go to the "Update" button in the "Packages" tab in RStudio.

``` r
# load the sbtools package
library(sbtools)
```
