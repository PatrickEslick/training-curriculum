## Lesson Summary

This lesson will explore how to find and download large gridded datasets via the R package `geoknife`. The package was created to allow easy access to data stored in the [Geo Data Portal (GDP)](https://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/), or any gridded dataset available through the [OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/) protocol DAP2. `geoknife` refers to the gridded dataset as the `fabric`, the spatial feature of interest as the `stencil`, and the subset algorithm parameters as the `knife` (see below).

## Lesson Objectives

Explore and query large gridded datasets for efficient and reproducible large-scale analyses.

By the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:

1. Explain the differences between remote and local processing.
2. Differentiate the three main concepts of this package: fabric, stencil, and knife.
3. Use this package to retrieve pre-processed data from the Geo Data Portal (GDP) via geoknife.
