"Items" are the objects in which ScienceBase stores and organizes data, and are necessary to understand for using `sbtools`. This lesson will introduce ScienceBase items and the R equivalent, `sbitem`. 

## What is a ScienceBase "item"?

A ScienceBase "item" is the fundamental digital object available through ScienceBase. Items can contain files, contain and display metadata, or contain other items to create a hierarchical item/folder structure. Items all follow the same type of metadata model, so they have a structured format. Visit the [ScienceBase Items help page](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/sciencebase-items) for more information, and look at the table below for some examples of items.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Item <- c(
  "[Oil producer well: Record Number 2016815](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58a36dcbe4b0c82512870172)", 
  "[Bathymetric DEM of the lower Nooksack River, August 2015](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58c03c2de4b014cc3a3bb802)", 
  "[Data for calculating population, collision and displacement vulnerability among marine birds of the California Current System associated with offshore wind energy infrastructure](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5733bc85e4b0dae0d5dd627b)"
)

Description <- c(
  "a standalone item",
  "item with files and metadata",
  "item that contains files and child items")

library(htmlTable)
htmlTable(data.frame(Item = Item, Description = Description), 
          caption="Table 1. ScienceBase item examples.",
          rnames=FALSE, align=c("l","l"), 
          col.rgroup = c("none", "#F7F7F7"), 
          css.cell="padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 0.5em;")
```

## What is an "sbitem"?

An `sbitem` is the `sbtools` equivalent of ScienceBase items. In R, ScienceBase items are represented with the class `sbitem`, which is a lightweight representation containing the item's essential metadata. `sbitems` also contain links that allow you to query ScienceBase for even more information on the item.

Below is an example of what an `sbitem` looks like in R. [This item](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e4b24e4b07f02db6aea14) was downloaded to the R object `itemexample`. The code to download this ScienceBase item will be explained in the lesson on [getting data from ScienceBase](#sbtools-download).

```{r sbitem-example, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(sbtools)
itemexample <- item_get("4f4e4b24e4b07f02db6aea14")
```

```{r sbitem-display, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# check class - it should be "sbitem"
class(itemexample)

# all fields in sbitem
names(itemexample)

# view the item
itemexample
```

There is a helper function available to verify that it has the `sbitem` class, `is.sbitem`. This would do the same check as `class(item) == "sbitem"`, just saves a bit of typing.

```{r sbtools-issbitem}
is.sbitem(itemexample)
```

## Additional item descriptions

In addition to metadata fields, ScienceBase items can be described by alternative identifiers, e.g. digital object identifiers, IPDS codes, etc. They can be useful to identify your items in searches because they have a user-defined type, scheme, and key.

For examples of identifiers, see the "Additional Information | Identifiers" section of [Differential Heating](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/580587a2e4b0824b2d1c1f23) (two sets of identifiers, one for a DOI and one for an IPDS, each of which has type/scheme/key) and [nwis_01645704](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/556f2055e4b0d9246a9fc9f7) (one set of identifiers; we invented the mda_streams scheme, with associated types and keys, to organize items in one of our own projects). You could create your own scheme to organize items, or use some of the [standardized schemes](https://www.sciencebase.gov/vocab/categories?offset=10&max=10&parentId=528e99f7e4b05d51c7038afd) that ScienceBase offers. 

Now that you understand the fundamental unit of ScienceBase and the `sbtools` equivalent unit, you can learn how to search ScienceBase for available data, download items, and modify or create items from R.
